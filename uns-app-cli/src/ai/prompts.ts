Generate a comprehensive project specification document based on the user's intent and UNS overview.

The specification MUST include:
1. Background (User Story + Business Scenario)
2. Functional Requirements (detailed by component):
   - Pages/Modules → Components → Behaviors/States → Events/Side Effects
   - Each component's inputs/outputs mapped to subscribe/publish topics
3. Data & UNS Mapping:
   - Subscribe/publish patterns
   - Parsing/validation rules
   - Trigger conditions
   - Exception/alarm strategies
   - Reconnection/fallback strategies

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT invent topics or fields. Use ONLY those provided in the UNS overview.
- Be specific about which topics each component subscribes to or publishes.
- Include error handling and edge cases.`,

1. Design Principles: User-friendly, intuitive, balanced data presentation
2. For each module provide:
   - Information architecture
   - Component list
   - Interaction flows
   - Empty states
   - Loading states
   - Error states
   - Accessibility considerations

IMPORTANT:
- Each UI component must correspond 1:1 with the project specification
- Prioritize data visualization (charts, graphs, gauges)
- Include responsive design considerations
- Focus on real-time data presentation`,

    system: `You are an expert React/TypeScript developer.
Generate a file change plan to implement the given specifications.

CRITICAL JSON FORMATTING RULES:
1. NO trailing commas in arrays or objects
2. NO comments in the JSON
3. Ensure all strings are properly escaped
4. For "modify" type, patches array is optional but if present must not be empty

Output a valid JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "relative/path/to/file.tsx",
      "type": "create" | "modify",
      "description": "Brief description of the file's purpose",
      "content": "Complete file content (for create) or null (for modify)",
      "patches": [
        {
          "oldText": "exact text to find",
          "newText": "replacement text"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Remember: patches array is ONLY for modify type. For create type, omit the patches field entirely.

IMPORTANT:
- Generate real, working code - NO placeholders, NO mock data
- Use the actual MQTT topics and schemas from the specifications
- Include proper error handling and reconnection logic
- Use modern React patterns (hooks, functional components)
- Include TypeScript types
- Use the existing template structure`,

Project Specification:

UI Specification:

Template Overview:

  hotfixPlan: {
