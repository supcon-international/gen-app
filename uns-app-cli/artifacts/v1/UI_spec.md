# UI Specification Document

## 1. Design Principles
- **User-friendly**: The dashboard will be designed to be intuitive, ensuring that users can easily navigate and access the necessary information without extensive training.
- **Intuitive**: All components should follow established design conventions, making them easy to understand and use.
- **Chart-first**: Priority will be given to visualizations (charts, graphs, gauges) over tabular data to facilitate quick comprehension of complex information.

## 2. Modules Overview

### 2.1. Real-time Data Feed Module

#### Information Architecture
- **Component Name**: Data Feed Module
- **Purpose**: To subscribe to various UNS topics to fetch real-time data.
- **Data Sources**: Multiple UNS topics related to production and inventory.

#### Component List
- Subscription Manager
- Data Parser
- Connection Status Indicator

#### Interaction Flows
1. **Connection Initiation**: On loading, the module subscribes to defined topics.
2. **Data Reception**: Upon receiving new data, the module updates the visualization components.
3. **Error Handling**: If a connection error occurs, display an error state and initiate a reconnection attempt.

#### Empty States
- Message: "No data available. Please check your connection or configuration."

#### Loading States
- Spinner indicating "Loading real-time data..."

#### Error States
- Message: "Connection lost. Retrying in X seconds..."
- Retry button: "Retry Now"

#### Accessibility Considerations
- Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, spinners) are keyboard accessible.
- Maintain ARIA roles to communicate state changes (e.g., loading, error) to screen readers.

### 2.2. Data Visualization Module

#### Information Architecture
- **Component Name**: Visualization Module
- **Purpose**: To render charts and graphs based on the data received from the Data Feed Module.

#### Component List
- Chart Container
- Line Chart for production trends
- Bar Chart for inventory levels
- Gauge for machine performance
- Alert Notifications

#### Interaction Flows
1. **Data Refresh**: On new data, the module automatically redraws visual elements.
2. **Chart Interaction**: Users can hover over charts for tooltips with detailed data.

#### Empty States
- Message: "No data available for visualization."

#### Loading States
- Spinner overlay on charts indicating "Loading data visualization..."

#### Error States
- Message: "Error loading visualizations. Please check data feed."

#### Accessibility Considerations
- Provide alternative text descriptions for all charts.
- Ensure charts are navigable via keyboard and screen readers.

### 2.3. Alert System Module

#### Information Architecture
- **Component Name**: Alert Module
- **Purpose**: To monitor key metrics and send alerts based on thresholds.

#### Component List
- Alert Notification Container
- Threshold Settings Panel
- Alert Log

#### Interaction Flows
1. **Threshold Monitoring**: Continuously checks metrics and compares against thresholds.
2. **Alert Display**: When a threshold is breached, an alert notification appears.

#### Empty States
- Message: "No alerts to display."

#### Loading States
- Spinner indicating "Checking metrics for alerts..."

#### Error States
- Message: "Unable to check metrics. Please check your connection."

#### Accessibility Considerations
- Alerts must be announced to screen readers.
- Ensure that all alerts can be dismissed via keyboard navigation.

## 3. Responsive Design Considerations
- **Layout**: The dashboard layout should adapt fluidly to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Charts**: Charts will resize based on the width available, maintaining aspect ratios for legibility.
- **Navigation**: Implement a collapsible side menu for mobile views to save space.

## 4. Real-time Data Presentation
- Data visualizations will be updated in real-time, ensuring that managers have the latest information at their fingertips.
- Use WebSockets for efficient real-time data streaming, minimizing latency.

## 5. Exception & Alarm Strategies
- Implement logging for all connection errors and alert triggers.
- Retry strategies will utilize exponential backoff for reconnect attempts.

## Conclusion
This UI specification document outlines the design principles and detailed requirements for each module in the dashboard. By prioritizing real-time data visualization and user-friendly design, the dashboard will empower factory managers to monitor operations efficiently and make informed decisions.
